\begin{abstract} \noindent This document describes the implementation of a class
for the Insight Toolkit (ITK) that takes an image with multi-component pixels and
outputs a scalar image for each component.  This can be useful when examining images
of vectors, tensors, etc.  This filter may be easier to use and require fewer
pixel visitations than an \doxygen{ImageAdaptor} with a similar purpose,
but it requires additional memory allocation.

\section{Introduction}

Often when working with images that have pixels containing multiple components,
it is desireable to address individual components.  Further analysis may only be
possible on separate components or one may simply want to view the components
individually.

There are a few classes meant to address this problem in the Insight Toolkit
(ITK).  The \doxygen{NthElementAdaptor} and \doxygen{VectorImageToImageAdaptor}
are \doxygen{ImageAdaptor}'s.  They are useful when iterating over the image but
only working with a single component.

Here we present a filter that produces multiple output images given a
multi-component input image.  This may be easier to work and may be more efficient
than the adaptors when all the components of the image are desired to appear as
scalar images.  However, additional memory consumption is required compared to
an adaptor.  We call this class the \code{itk::SplitComponentsImageFilter}.

\section{Class Overview}

The \code{itk::SplitComponentsImageFilter} inherits from
\doxygen{ImageToImageFilter}.  The filter takes a multi-component image as an
input, and multiple output scalar images are present on the output corresponding
to the component number.  The class extracts components of an \doxygen{Image} of
\doxygen{Vector}'s, \doxygen{CovariantVector}'s,
\doxygen{SymmetricSecondRankTensor}'s, or other classes that have the same
interface.  The pixel's interface must implement \code{ValueType operator[] ( unsigned
int )}.

The class is templated over the input image type, the output image type, and the
number of components in the input image pixels.

Implementation is multi-threaded.  A subset of the outputs can be allocated and
populated with the \code{SetComponentMask} method.

\section{An Example}

A sample executable that writes individual scalar component images from a
multi-component input image is included with the source code.  An excerpt
follows:

\begin{verbatim}
  typedef itk::SplitComponentsImageFilter< InputImageType, OutputImageType,
          TComponents > FilterType;
  typename FilterType::Pointer filter = FilterType::New();
  filter->SetInput( reader->GetOutput() );

  typedef itk::ImageFileWriter< OutputImageType > WriterType;
  typename WriterType::Pointer writer = WriterType::New();

  std::ostringstream ostr;
  for( unsigned int i = 0; i < TComponents; ++i )
    {
    ostr.str( "" );
    ostr << args.outputPrefix << "Component" << i << ".mha";
    writer->SetInput( filter->GetOutput( i ) );
    writer->SetFileName( ostr.str() );
    writer->Update();
    }
\end{verbatim}
